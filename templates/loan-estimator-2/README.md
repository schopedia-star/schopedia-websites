# Loan Estimator Widget

This template is a self-contained, front-end only loan estimator you can paste
into an Odoo website snippet. It uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no
backend required).

## Odoo usage

1. Copy the HTML from `index.html`.
2. Paste it into an Odoo **Custom HTML** block.
3. Copy the contents of `style.css` into the page's **Custom CSS** area.
4. Copy the contents of `script.js` into the page's **Custom JavaScript** area.

You can customize the min/max ranges in the HTML `input` fields and the color
palette in `style.css` to match your brand.
